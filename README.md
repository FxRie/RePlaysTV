# RePlaysTV
A client modification for Plays.tv

This patches over the existing Plays.tv software to give it a custom user interface with plenty of upload platforms.

On 12/15/19, Plays.tv discontinued support to their website and desktop application.

This is a non-profit, community based project to extend the life of the Plays.tv client for future use.
