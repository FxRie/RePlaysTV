# RePlaysTV
A client modification for Plays.tv

If you are coming here wondering where the last repo went, it was deleted because it was infringing on Plays.tv's copyright (since it was containing their source code, files, etc) and I was told to delete it. 

This repo will contain no source code/relating files that is copyrighted by Plays.tv, this is simply a patch or mod (made from scratch) for the existing client.

This is a non-profit, community based project to extend the life of the Plays.tv client for offline use.

On 12/15/19, Plays.tv will discontinue support to their website and desktop application.

Currently in development, no releases. Currently based on Plays 2.2.0. Planning for a release before 12/15.
